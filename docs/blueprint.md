create an app that allows user to just tap a button and say "aRISE" every 24 hours. When tapping, user will be prompted to connect to their EVM wallet on the RISE chain testnet and go through the transaction flow.

After successfully saying aRISE, user can also share a custom invite link on their X account or their Telegram chat to invite others to join them.
