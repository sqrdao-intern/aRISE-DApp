# aRISE DApp Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
We're building a DApp that interacts with the RISE Chain testnet. We've updated the network configuration to use the correct RPC URLs from the official documentation. Now we're facing an error with a contract function call.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
The contract function "getTotalAriseCount" is returning no data ("0x"). The error suggests several possibilities:
1. The contract doesn't have a function called "getTotalAriseCount"
2. The parameters passed to the function may be invalid
3. The address is not a contract

**Analysis Findings:**
- The contract address is defined in `src/lib/constants.ts` as `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`, which is indeed a placeholder
- The ABI in `src/lib/constants.ts` includes the `getTotalAriseCount` function with the correct signature
- The function is being called in `src/components/arise-button.tsx` using this placeholder address
- The `contracts` directory is empty, suggesting we need to deploy the contract to the RISE testnet

## Research on Contract Deployment Options

### Thirdweb Deployment
Thirdweb offers a no-code solution for deploying smart contracts to EVM-compatible chains. Based on research:

1. Thirdweb claims to support 2,000+ EVM chains
2. Deployment is as simple as running `npx thirdweb deploy` in a project containing contracts
3. It provides a user-friendly dashboard for contract management and interaction
4. Contract verification is automatic
5. No private keys required - deployment occurs through wallet connection

However, I couldn't find specific confirmation that Thirdweb supports RISE Chain testnet (Chain ID: 11155931) in their documentation or chainlist.

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Use Existing RISE Testnet Contracts**
   - The RISE testnet includes pre-deployed tokens like WETH, USDC, USDT, and others that could be used for testing
   - These are documented at: https://docs.risechain.com/rise-testnet/testnet-tokens.html

2. **Deploy via RISE Faucet Portal**
   - RISE has a testnet portal at https://portal.testnet.riselabs.xyz/ that includes a faucet
   - This might provide an easier way to acquire testnet tokens and possibly deploy contracts

3. **Manual Contract Deployment**
   - We can follow the steps in the RISE developer quickstart (https://docs.risechain.com/build-on-rise/developer-quickstart.html)
   - Standard tools like Hardhat or Foundry with the correct RPC URL and Chain ID should work

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Explore Thirdweb Deployment**
   - Install Thirdweb CLI with `npm install -g @thirdweb-dev/cli`
   - Run `npx thirdweb deploy` to see if RISE Chain testnet is available
   - If available, deploy the contract through Thirdweb's interface
   - Success Criteria: Contract deployed with a valid address on RISE testnet

2. **Manual Contract Deployment (Alternative)**
   - Prepare a minimal Hardhat or Foundry environment
   - Configure the project with the RISE testnet RPC URL and Chain ID
   - Deploy the contract using standard deployment procedures
   - Success Criteria: Contract deployed with a valid address on RISE testnet

3. **Update Contract Configuration**
   - Update the contract address in `src/lib/constants.ts` with the deployed contract address
   - Verify the ABI matches the deployed contract
   - Success Criteria: Contract configuration correctly updated in the codebase

4. **Test Contract Interaction**
   - Verify contract calls work with the new address
   - Check that the getTotalAriseCount function returns proper data
   - Success Criteria: Successfully call the contract function without errors

5. **Update UI Components**
   - Ensure the arise-button.tsx component correctly displays contract data
   - Success Criteria: UI displays contract data correctly

No feedback yet.

## Lessons
- Always verify contract addresses and ABIs when integrating with blockchain networks
- Test contract interactions before implementing UI components
- Use placeholder addresses only for development; ensure real addresses are used for production or testnet deployments
- Make sure to use the correct RPC URLs and chain IDs for the target network
