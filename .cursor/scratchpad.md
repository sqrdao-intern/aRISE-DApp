# aRISE DApp Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The current implementation needs several UI improvements to enhance user experience:
1. Arise counts need to be updated after transaction confirmation
2. A 24-hour cooldown period needs to be implemented for the button
3. Social sharing options need to be added after successful transactions

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **State Management**:
   - Need to track last transaction time for each wallet
   - Need to persist this information across sessions
   - Need to handle multiple wallet connections

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Arise counts need to be updated immediately after transaction confirmation
   - Countdown timer needs to be accurate and update in real-time
   - Need to handle edge cases like network disconnections

3. **Social Sharing**:
   - Need to generate shareable content with user's Arise count
   - Need to handle different social platform requirements
   - Need to ensure sharing links work correctly

## Lessons
- Keep notification logic centralized to prevent duplicates
- Use state tracking to prevent redundant notifications
- Coordinate between different status checking mechanisms
- Use refs to track notification timing across re-renders
- Implement cooldown periods for notifications to prevent spam
